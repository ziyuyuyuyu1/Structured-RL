## Updates
* 18/06/2025: We update the evaluation results on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (see details below) on different context length ([8k](https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR?tab=readme-ov-file#evaluation-length--8192), [32k](https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR?tab=readme-ov-file#evaluation-length--32768)) and show consistent improvement from few-shot RLVR. **Note: A summary replying the confusion regarding the evaluation of our DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B is available [here](https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR/issues/22#issuecomment-3076462285)**. Also see our results with 32k length below.
* 17/05/2025: We release our [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/collections/ypwang61/one-shot-rlvr-6827f72c3359b2ffe75fc1a8) and [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ypwang61/one_shot_rlvr) in huggingface.
* 30/04/2025: üéâ We release our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20571), [code](https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR), and [wandb records](https://wandb.ai/yipingwanguw/verl_few_shot?nw=nwuseryipingwang22). See the summarization of our work at [X(twitter)](https://x.com/ypwang61/status/1917596101953348000).


## Setup


### Train Enviroment
Our training pipeline is adapted from [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) and  [rllm(DeepScaleR)](https://github.com/agentica-project/rllm). The installation commands that we verified as viable are as follows:
```bash
conda create -y -n rlvr_train python=3.10
conda activate rlvr_train
pip install -e .
pip install torch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 torchaudio==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install ray vllm==0.6.3
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
pip install wandb matplotlib
pip install huggingface_hub
```
If you are using H100 nodes and see errors like `CUDA error: device kernel image is invalid`, please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR/issues/22#issuecomment-3066442183) for fixing the problem.

### Eval Enviroment
Our evaluation pipeline for math reasoning tasks is adapted from [Qwen2.5-Math](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math). The installation commands that we verified as viable are as follows:
```bash
conda create -y -n rlvr_eval python=3.10
conda activate rlvr_eval
cd Qwen2.5-Eval/evaluation
cd latex2sympy
pip install -e .
cd ..
pip install -r requirements.txt 
pip install vllm==0.5.1 --no-build-isolation
pip install transformers==4.42.3
pip install wandb matplotlib
pip install -U transformers
pip install vllm==0.6.3
```


## Data
### DSR-sub
We randomly select a subset consisting of 1209 examples from [DeepScaleR-Preview-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agentica-org/DeepScaleR-Preview-Dataset) (DSR-sub), and we use it as the instance pool for data selection. We include the training example used in our paper in `data/train/one_shot_rlvr`. For 1(few)-shot RLVR dataset, we duplicate the data until training batch size (in our experiment it is 128). 



(Optionally) To obtain the training example, we rank DSR-sub by the historical variance score, which calculates the variance of the historical accuracy (We hope this can inspire better data selection way in the future). To obtain examples $\pi_i$ based on the historical accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we can change the `top_index` parameter in `data/data_selection.sh` to $i-1$, and run then run `bash data_selection.sh`.


As a reference, we present example $\pi_1$ here: 
<!-- and $\pi_{13}$ as follows. -->

#### $\pi_1$:
```text
Prompt:
"The pressure \\( P \\) exerted by wind on a sail varies jointly as the area \\( A \\) of the sail and the cube of the wind's velocity \\( V \\). When the velocity is \\( 8 \\) miles per hour, the pressure on a sail of \\( 2 \\) square feet is \\( 4 \\) pounds. Find the wind velocity when the pressure on \\( 4 \\) square feet of sail is \\( 32 \\) pounds. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}."

Ground truth (label in DSR-sub):
12.8.
```

<!-- #### $\pi_{13}$:
```text
Prompt:
"Given that circle $C$ passes through points $P(0,-4)$, $Q(2,0)$, and $R(3,-1)$.  \n$(1)$ Find the equation of circle $C$.  \n$(2)$ If the line $l: mx+y-1=0$ intersects circle $C$ at points $A$ and $B$, and $|AB|=4$, find the value of $m$. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}."

Ground truth (label in DSR-sub):
\frac{4}{3}.
``` -->


## Training
Before training, we can assign the checkpoint path:
```bash
export CHECKPOINTS_DIR=./checkpoints # your checkpoint path
export WANDB_API_KEY=... # your wandb api key
```

To run 1-shot RLVR with $\pi_1$, we can run:
```bash
conda activate rlvr_train
bash scripts/train/training_1.5b_pi1_r128.sh
```

As a comparison, the commands for running full-set RLVR on DSR-sub is as below:
```bash
conda activate rlvr_train
bash scripts/train/training_1.5b_dsr_sub.sh 
```

Please change `data.train_files` and `trainer.experiment_name` in the training script when trying other training examples.

## Evaluation

### Eval Scripts for Qwen Models
To run evaluation for 1-shot RLVR with $\pi_1$ on 6 common math reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AIME24, AMC23, Minerva Math, OlympiadBench, AIME25), we can follow the commands:
```bash
conda activate rlvr_eval
cd Qwen2.5-Eval/evaluation
export VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD=spawn
bash sh/eval_one_experiment_all_ckpts.sh
```
Here for AIME24, AMC23, and AIME25, we evaluate the pass@8 results.
Please adjust the experiment name in `Qwen2.5-Eval/evaluation/sh/eval_one_experiment_all_ckpts.sh` when using other training examples. 


### Evaluation for DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B

For DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, we can also evaluate based on [rllm(DeepScaleR)](https://github.com/agentica-project/rllm) official repo. As DeepSeek-R1 and DeepScaleR, we use `temperature=0.6` and `top_p=0.95` for evaluation, and use `avg@16` for MATH500, Minerva MAth & OlympiadBench, ang `avg@64` for AIME24, AIME25 and AMC23. Since our training length is 8192, we provide the evaluations results for both 8k and 32k evaluation length. The results can be reproduced by provided [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/collections/ypwang61/one-shot-rlvr-6827f72c3359b2ffe75fc1a8).

## W&B
We have logged our experiments for three models to [this wandb project](https://wandb.ai/yipingwanguw/verl_few_shot?nw=nwuseryipingwang22), including the results of 1(few)-shot RLVR on [`Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B), [`Qwen2.5-Math-7B`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-7B) and [`DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B`](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B). We also include the baseline of the full-set RLVR with DSR-sub in it. Please note that the validation results displayed are calculated using the verl/rllm framework and may differ slightly from qwen-eval results.
